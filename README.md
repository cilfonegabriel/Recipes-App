# 📖 Blog App <a name="about-project"></a>

**Recipes App** The Recipe App is a web application built using the Ruby on Rails framework, that provides users with a platform to create, modify and remove recipes. Users can decide whether to make their recipes public or private, depending on whether they want to share them with others or keep them to themselves. Moreover, the app has a useful feature that allows users to generate a shopping list based on the food items required for their selected recipes.

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
